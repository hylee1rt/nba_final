# NBA Draft Analysis (2010-2021).

Prior to every NBA (National Basketball Association) season, NBA teams select new players out of college and international
leagues in a draft. Ultimately, 60 players are selected in order from pick 1 through 60. The purpose of our analysis/study is to
examine the relationship between which pick a player was selected with and that players 1st year performance. To do this,
we compiled a dataset containing the draft pick a player was selected with, the team that selected the player, that player’s
descriptive statistics (ex. age, college attended, etc), and that player’s rookie year statistics (ex. assists, blocks, points per
game, etc). We believed that we could get a good sense of a player performance by looking at a player’s season and per
game statistics. Using the data, we first created a correlation matrix with selected features within our dataset to get a sense
of the underlying relationships within the data. Utilizing the correlation matrix and further visualizations we will seek to
understand the deeper relationships between our variables, with an important focus on the relationship between a player’s
pick and that players rookie statistics.

Our dataset has 32 columns, and 660 rows. Due to having a high number of features, it
is important that we focus in and pinpoint the specific features we are trying to examine in relationship to
when a player is picked. It is important that we do not get lost in potentially redundant data or irrelevant
data within our dataset. The correlation matrix we have currently only contains 14 out of the 32 features, so
our next steps would be to hone in on the variables that we want to further examine (whether that be
by adding more features or take away features from the correlation matrix).
