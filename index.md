# NBA Draft Analysis (2010-2021)

Once per year, prior to every NBA (National Basketball Association) season, NBA teams select new players out of college and international leagues in a draft. Ultimately, 60 players are selected in  order from pick 1 through 60. The purpose of our analysis/study is to examine the relationship between  which pick a player was selected with and that player’s 1st year performance and will be looking at the  last 11 drafts (2010-2021). To do this, we compiled a dataset containing the draft pick a player was selected with, the team that selected the player, that player’s descriptive statistics (ex. age, college attended, state of college attended, etc.), and that player’s rookie year statistics (ex. assists, blocks, points per game, etc.).


Our dataset has 32 columns, and 660 rows. Due to having a high number of features, it
is important that we focus in and pinpoint the specific features we are trying to examine in relationship to
when a player is picked. It is important that we do not get lost in potentially redundant data or irrelevant
data within our dataset. The correlation matrix we have currently only contains 14 out of the 32 features, so
our next steps would be to hone in on the variables that we want to further examine (whether that be
by adding more features or take away features from the correlation matrix).
